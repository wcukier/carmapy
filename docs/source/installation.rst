Installation
===============

Installation with git
---------------------
Currently this is the only way to install carmapy::

   git clone https://github.com/wcukier/carmapy
   cd carmapy
   pip install -e .


Testing Installation
--------------------
To test that carmapy is installed correctly you can run the following python code

.. code-block:: python

   import carmapy.example

   carma = carmapy.example.example_carma("test")
   carma.run()

if everything is running correctly, a directory named "test" should have been created in the directory where you ran this code.  Additionally you should see that the model began running as it prints its current timestepâ€”you may stop the run once you see it is running but if you let it run uninterrupted, the code should finish running in a few minutes.  Feel free to delete the "test" directory once you are sure everything is running correctly
